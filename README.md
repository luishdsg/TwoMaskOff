**Objective**: a posting system in `angular-cli`and `Json-server`, which can be optimized to use all REST tools in JS (edit, delete, change and post)... with a tribal theme LOL.



## STEP BY STEP

```
npm install
```
#or

```
yarn install
```


**now you need to start the project for that run** 

```
npm start
```

#we are using `concurrently` to start both scripts at the same time

```
 "start": "concurrently  \"npm run data\"  \"npm run play\""
```
